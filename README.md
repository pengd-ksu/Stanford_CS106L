# Stanford_CS106L
Learn C++ with relatively new features from this class since it's required in my job. Lots of modern features were covered in the lectures. If you are in urgent needs to learn C++ like me, this lecture is definitely worth a try in a short time with some background in object-oriented programming. More practices are needed to master the details, of course, just like coding in very programming language.
Most codes under lectures are provided by Stanford staff, I added some personal practice to cover more details and fulfill educational initiative
